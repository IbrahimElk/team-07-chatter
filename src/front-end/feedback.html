                    Keystroke fingerprinting is a technique that involves analysing an individual's typing patterns to identify them based on how fast they type. Essentially, each person's typing style is unique, like a fingerprint, and can be used to distinguish them from others.When we type, we use a combination of keystrokes, including letters, numbers and special characters. Our own keystroke fingerprinting algorithms analyse the timing of these keystrokes to create a unique profile for each user. This profile can then be used to identify the user with a high degree of accuracy. The process of keystroke fingerprinting begins by collecting data on an individual's typing pattern, the time between the different keystrokes. This data is then used to create a model that represents the individual's typing style. Once the model is created, it can be used to compare future typing samples to determine if they were made  by the same individual, or an imposter.
                    In general, keystroke fingerprinting has a wide range of applications, including int the fields of cybersecurity and biometrics. We use it primarily for security reasons, so no other person than yourself can send messages in your name. It therefore leans towards the field of biometrics.
 
 
                    While keystroke fingerprinting can be an effective tool for identifying individuals, it is not without its limitations. For example, changes in an individual's typing patterns, such as typing speed or keyboard layout, can affect the accuracy of the algorithm. Additionally, keystroke fingerprinting may be less reliable for individuals who have physical disabilities that affect their typing patterns
 
 
                    Overall, keystroke fingerprinting is a powerful tool for identifying individuals based on their unique typing style
