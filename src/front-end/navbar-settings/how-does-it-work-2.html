                  Zeveraars is a handy app that is created especially for KU Leuven students. After registration, you
                  can choose your own avatar, which you will use to represent yourself. Once you log in, you will be
                  able to access your individual class schedule. This ensures that you will never miss a lesson again.
                  The homepage, which is a 3D map of Campus Arenberg, can be used to find your way to the classroom. By
                  hovering over one of the buildings, you can see the name of the auditorium and the class that is
                  currently taking place there. If you click on the building, you'll be immediately directed to the
                  appropriate class's chatroom. In this chatroom, you can ask any questions you have about the subject
                  of this lesson. This makes it simple for you to communicate with the other students, without
                  disrupting the class. Additionally, by selecting an avatar and then clicking “chat”, users have the
                  opportunity to start private conversations. Finally, Zeveraars allows you to add or remove friends,
                  making it simple to collaborate with other pupils. Overall, Zeveraars is a useful tool that makes your
                  live as a student at KU Leuven much simpler.
