                  Our chat application, just like all the other chat applications, had a pretty basic working. It allows
                  the users to send and receive text messages in real time over the internet. To use the chat
                  application, you need to create an account. You can do this by clicking on the register page. If you
                  already have an account, you can log in by clicking on the login page. Once logged in, the user can
                  join channels, based on different courses , or chat with friends in private.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a channel, your messages are visible to all participants in the channel. However, if you want to
                  chat with a friend privately, you can do so by clicking on the user's name in your friendlist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A message is sent simply by clicking the send button, ofcourse after you typed your message in the
                  textfield. If you're a fast living person, you can also send your message by pressing the enter key.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After your session, it is convenient to log out. This can be done by clicking on the profile button in
                  the right upper corner. Then you can click on the logout button. By doing this, you'll prevent that
                  some other person can communicate with your fellow students and friends in your name. So be safe and
                  log out!
