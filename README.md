# CHATTER

## Description

A basic terminal-based chat application consisting of a central server and several chat clients.
Users can add friends and send and receive messages to and from them.
Keystroke analysis of messages (based on timings of n-grams) is used to compare those with those of previously recorded messages to hopefully detect an possible impostor.
