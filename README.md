# CHATTER
https://zeveraar.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/
## Description

A basic webpage-based chat application consisting of a central server and several chat clients.
Users can add friends and send and receive messages to and from them. They can also join channels to chat with multiple persons.
Keystroke analysis of messages (based on timings of n-grams) is used to compare those with those of previously recorded messages to hopefully detect an possible impostor.
